# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithm Practices (Lab Exercise) 💖

Hey there! Welcome to my little corner of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) lab practice**. ✨  
This repository contains all my lab exercises, neatly organized by topic — from **structures and arrays** to **linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps**, and more! It's my personal playground for learning and experimenting with C++ 💻💕

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++**
- **Visual Studio Code**

---

## ✨ What You Can Do Here
Here’s a sneak peek of what this repository lets you do:  
- Run each C++ file to see different **data structures** and algorithms in action.  
- Compare how different structures behave in different situations.  
- Study topic-by-topic with **organized folders**.  
- Explore lab-style DSA problem implementations.

## 📝 My Learning Process
These exercises were developed from my **lab questions and practice tasks**. For tricky topics like **stacks, queues, and binary trees**, I often did **pen-and-paper tracing** ✏️📝 to follow the logic step by step before coding.  

This helped me understand:  
- How values move through each structure  
- How operations like **insert, delete, push, pop, and traversal** actually work internally

## 🎓 What I Learned
### 🧩 Core Data Structures
- Hands-on experience with arrays, matrices, and structured data  
- How linked lists and circular linked lists connect data dynamically  

### 🧠 Algorithmic Thinking
- Tracing logic step-by-step to predict outputs  
- Understanding stack and queue operations behind the scenes  

### 🌳 Trees & Heaps
- How binary trees, heaps, and B-trees are structured and traversed  
- Basic insertion and organization rules for hierarchical data
